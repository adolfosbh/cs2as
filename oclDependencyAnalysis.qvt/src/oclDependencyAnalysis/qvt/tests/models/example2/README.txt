Some files descriptions.

1. Run Configurations at (launchConfs/example2):
a) Classes CS2AS (QVTp 2 QVTs) -> First ETL transformation to create an initial QVTs model.
b) Classes CS2AS - Scheduling -> An EOL script to update the QVTs with the final scheduling.
c) Classes CS2AS (QVTs+p 2 QVTi) -> Second ETL transformation to create the final QVTi model from the QVTs+QVTp models.

2. Relevant files:
a) ClassesCS2Classes.ocl -> Original CompleteOCL document describing the mapping between the CS & AS.
b) classescs2as.input.qvtp.qvti -> Manual qvtp file, which contains an equivalent description of the CompleteOCL document, written in QVTp. This one will be removed soon.
c) classescs2as.qvtp.qvti -> The same as the previous one but automatically generated from a). It's the real input to the Horacios transformations
                             This one is the one use by the Launch Configurations (1.a, 1.b and 1.c).
d) classescs2asSchedule.xmi -> The QVTs model. It's created in two different steps, 1.a) and 1.b)
e) classescs2.qvtias -> The final QVTi model generated by 1.c)                    

Notes:
- Classescs2as_v2.input.qvt.qvti is another QVTp transformation corresponding to the Complete OCL document. In this case, the transformation relies on a cross-reference between
the CS and the AS so that a middle model doesn't need to be created.
- There is now a working "Classes Example - (OCL 2 QVTi)" launch conf, which automatically generates 2.c) from 2.a).
- 24/11 OCL2QVTiTestCases now launches all the transformation chain.

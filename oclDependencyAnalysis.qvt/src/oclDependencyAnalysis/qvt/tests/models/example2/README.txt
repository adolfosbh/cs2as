Some files descriptions.

1. Run Configurations at (launchConfs/example2):
a) Classes CS2AS (QVTp 2 QVTs) -> First ETL transformation to create an initial QVTs model.
b) Classes CS2AS - Scheduling -> An EOL script to update the QVTs with the final scheduling.
c) Classes CS2AS (QVTs+p 2 QVTi) -> Second ETL transformation to create the final QVTi model from the QVTs+QVTp models.

2. Relevant files:
a) ClassesCS2Classes.ocl -> Original CompleteOCL document describing the mapping between the CS & AS.
b) classescs2as.input.qvtp.qvti -> Manual qvtp file, which contains an equivalent description of the CompleteOCL document, written in QVTp.
c) classescs2as.output.qvtp.qvti -> Generated qvtp file, generated from the ClassCS2Classes.ocl file. 
d) classescs2as.qvtp.qvti -> The same as the previous one/twos. It's the real input to the Horacios transformations which is normally copied from one of the previous QVTp transformations.
                             Horacio MTC modifies the QVTp file when scheduling (to add the root/top/main mapping), so I want to have the previous one is the untouched one, 
                             i.e. when executing 1.b). This one is the one use by the Launch Configurations (1.a, 1.b and 1.c).
e) classescs2asSchedule.xmi -> The QVTs model. It's created in two different steps, 1.a) and 1.b)
f) classescs2.qvtias -> The final QVTi model generated by 1.c)
g) classescs2.target.qvtias -> A manually created QVTi file with a plausible -not optimal, though- transformation to execute.                    

Notes:
- Classescs2as_v2.input.qvt.qvti is another QVTp transformation corresponding to the Complete OCL document. In this case, the transformation relies on a cross-reference between
the CS and the AS so that a middle model doesn't need to be created.
- There is now a working "Classes Example - (OCL 2 QVTi)" launch conf, which automatically generates 2.c) from 2.a).
- 24/11 OCL2QVTiTestCases now launches all the transformation chain.

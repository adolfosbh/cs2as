Some files descriptions.

1. Run Configurations at (launchConfs/example2):
a) Classes CS2AS (QVTp 2 QVTs) -> First ETL transformation to create an initial QVTs model.
b) Classes CS2AS - Scheduling -> An EOL script to update the QVTs with the final scheduling.
c) Classes CS2AS (QVTs+p 2 QVTi) -> Second ETL transformation to create the final QVTi model from the QVTs+QVTp models.

2. Relevant files:
a) ClassesCS2Classes.ocl -> Original CompleteOCL document describing the mapping between the CS & AS.
b) classescs2as.input.qvtp.qvti -> Manual qvtp file, which contains an equivalent description of the CompleteOCL document, written in QVTp.
c) classescs2as.qvtp.qvti -> The same as the previous one, since Horacio MTC modifies the QVTp file when scheduling (to add the root/top/main mapping) 
                            the previous one is the untouched one, i.e. when executing 1.b). This one is the one use by the Launch Configuration.
d) classescs2asSchedule.xmi -> The QVTs model. It's created in two different steps, 1.a) and 1.b)
e) classescs2.qvtias -> The final QVTi model generated by 1.c)
f) classescs2.target.qvtias -> A manually created QVTi file with a plausible -not optimal, though- transformation to execute.
                           

Note:
classescs2as_v2.input.qvt.qvti is another QVTp transformation corresponding to the Complete OCL document. In this case, the transformation relies on a cross-reference between
the CS and the AS so that a middle model doesn't need to be created.
